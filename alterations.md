## This is where I am going to add the changes that I have made to the website.

### I added focus to my anchor tags so that there is a border around it when someone tabs around the page. This is good for people who do not have  the ability to use a mouse and need to use a keyboard for everyone as well as people whose eyesight is not the best. The color of the outline plus the width of the border makes it easy for someone to spot the location of where the focus on the website is.

### alt tags have been added to all of the image elements inside of the html document.

### A title has been added to the div with a class of 'hero' just in case google wants to honor the title with a validation for better seo and also for screen readers. I chose to do this because the image has been placed in the css of the website instead of inside of an image tag on the html page itself.
