#Homework one alterations
## This is where I am going to add the changes that I have made to the website.

### 1. I added focus to my anchor tags so that there is a border around it when someone tabs around the page. This is good for people who do not have  the ability to use a mouse and need to use a keyboard for everyone as well as people whose eyesight is not the best. The color of the outline plus the width of the border makes it easy for someone to spot the location of where the focus on the website is.

### 2. alt tags have been added to all of the image elements inside of the html document.

### 3. A title has been added to the div with a class of 'hero' just in case google wants to honor the title with a validation for better seo and also for screen readers. I chose to do this because the image has been placed in the css of the website instead of inside of an image tag on thgit e html page itself. 

### 4. Removed header class and input semantic header tags in both the html and css.

### 5. Replaced div around the navigation with the navigation html tag and then changed out the word 'div' in the css tags with the word navigation.

### 6. Replaced the div with the class of content with a section tag instead because it is more semantic.

### 7. Replacing the div with a class of social-media-marketing with a semantic article tag with a class of social-media-marketing.

### 8. Changed the tag surrounding the benefits section from a div tag to a section tag.

### 9. Changed the individual div tags describing the articles inside of the benefits section over to semantic article tags.

### 10. Changing div footer tag over to a semantic footer tag.
